# What this is
This is a incomplete Unity 2D toy RPG game project I wrote in 2022.

# Context
My main goals were to learn about Unity and concepts such as data management with scriptable objects, creating multiple types of scenes (ex: world map, town/dungeon maps, combat, merchants), gameplay systems (dialogues, combat, inventories, character leveling, quests), world persistence, loading & saving external data, using store assets, custom editors, and managing events.

# Libraries & Files
Assets not related directly to scripting are not included in this repository. The project relies on certain commercial assets and plugins such as animancer and DOTween, which are not included in this repository.
